//Flyweight pattern optimizes memory usage by sharing common data between objects instead of duplicating it.
//When you're dealing with a large number of similar objects and want to minimize memory footprint.
//In this example, we want to render thousands of similar icons in a file explorer. 
//This pattern lets you reuse the same folderIcon instead of creating new instances every time.

class Icon {

  constructor(type: string) {
